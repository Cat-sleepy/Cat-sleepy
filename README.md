<h1> This is Real ... This is Me </h1>

When I am wake I do stuff as a Communication Designer and New Media Artist, moving between graphic design, multimedia, photography, and interactive art. My work flows across disciplines, but always returns to one core intention: to communicate ideas with visual intensity and technical care.

At present, I develop visual materials for institutional and cultural communication, while nurturing an active artistic practice. My creative research explores themes such as identity, silence, and presence — through video, digital animation, AI-generated imagery, and live performance.

As a visual storyteller, I seek to create experiences that resonate — images that breathe, move, and speak beyond words. I work with tools like Adobe Creative Suite, MadMapper, and other digital platforms, embracing a constant rhythm of learning and experimentation.

Driven by curiosity, attentive to detail, and deeply passionate about the intersection of art, design, and technology, I believe in the power of images to evoke, to clarify, and to connect — whether in a street poster, an immersive installation, or a digital interface.
